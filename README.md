Dijkstra Algorithm.
On a randomly generated graph of 50 nodes with weights ranging from 1.0 to 10.0,
the node names are from 0 to 49.
Get an average of the shortest path total weight, computing the Dijkstra algorithm for the 49 paths:
0 to 1, 0 to 2, 0 to 3, â€¦, 0 to 49.

To run the program go to main.cpp
